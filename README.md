# responsive_layout_v2.0
This project is for unit 2 of my Treehouse Techdegree Program.
The goal was to create from scratch the code needed to match the provided mockups.
The mockups provided included a mobile first approach to responsive design.
The pages should match the mockup at the three indicated screen sizes of 320px,768px,1024px.
